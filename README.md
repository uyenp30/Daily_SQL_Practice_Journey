# 🚀 SQL_Practice_Journey
A collection of my SQL practice problems from HackerRank and Leetcode

---

Welcome to my repository dedicated to honing my SQL skills through regular practice. This space serves as a living document of my progress, a library of solved challenges, and a showcase of my problem-solving abilities in SQL.

I tackle new challenges from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank to continuously improve my understanding of database querying, from basic syntax to advanced topics like window functions, CTEs, and complex joins.

Feel free to check out my profiles on those platforms:

* **LeetCode:** [[Uyen Pham]](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/phamlanuyen30)
* **HackerRank:** [[UyenPham]](https://leetcode.com/u/UyenPham/)

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The structure is designed to clearly separate problems by their platform of origin and their given difficulty level.

The main directories are:

* **`📁 LeetCode/`**: Contains all solutions for problems from LeetCode.
* **`📁 HackerRank/`**: Contains all solutions for problems from HackerRank.

### File Naming Convention

Instead of using sub-folders for difficulty, each solution file is named using a consistent format that clearly states its difficulty, order, and name. This makes browsing and sorting simple and efficient.

The format is: **`Difficulty_##_Problem_Name`**

For example:
* `Easy_01_Second_Highest_Salary`
* `Medium_01_Consecutive_Numbers`
* `Hard_01_Trips_and_Users`

This structure helps in quickly identifying a problem's difficulty and solution at a glance.
