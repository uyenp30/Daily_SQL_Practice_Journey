# 🚀 Daily_SQL_Practice_Journey
A collection of my daily SQL practice problems from HackerRank and Leetcode

---

Welcome to my repository dedicated to honing my SQL skills through daily practice. This space serves as a living document of my progress, a library of solved challenges, and a showcase of my problem-solving abilities in SQL.

Every day, I tackle new challenges from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank to continuously improve my understanding of database querying, from basic syntax to advanced topics like window functions, CTEs, and complex joins.

Feel free to check out my profiles on those platforms:

* **LeetCode:** [[Uyen Pham]](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/phamlanuyen30)
* **HackerRank:** [[UyenPham]](https://leetcode.com/u/UyenPham/)

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The structure is designed to clearly separate problems by their platform of origin and their given difficulty level.

The main directories are:

* **`📁 LeetCode/`**: Contains all solutions for problems from LeetCode.
* **`📁 HackerRank/`**: Contains all solutions for problems from HackerRank.

Within each of these directories, the solutions are further categorized by difficulty:

* **`📁 Easy/`**

### File Naming Convention

Each solution file is named using a consistent format to ensure clarity and chronological order:

`[Problem_Number]_[Problem_Name].sql`

For example, a solution for the first challenge in the "Easy" LeetCode section would be named:

**`01_Second_Highest_Salary.sql`**

This structure helps in quickly identifying a problem and its solution.
